5) As a registered user I want to be able to persist my posts to a database so that I can view historical posts.

6) As a registered user I want to be able to "like" others posts so that other users will be aware if I support their content.

7) As a registered user I want to be able to determine how many likes my posts and which users have liked my posts so that I can use this information to guide how I interact with other applicatoin users.

8) As a registered user I want to be able to view how many clicks my posts have but without being able to see which users have clicked due to privacy concerns. 

9) As a registered user I want to be able to select an avatar or upload a profile picture and create a short bio or page description to personalize my postings.

10) As a registered user I want to be able to update my posts so that I can improve on them with new information/ideas or images.

11) As a registered user I want to be able to delete my posts so that if I determine I want to take down an idea, this will be a straightforward process.
